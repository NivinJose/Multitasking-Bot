# Multitasking-Bot

**Project Description:** Multitasking Bot with Line Following, Obstacle Avoidance, and Android Application Control

**Features:**

**Line Following:**
                  The bot will be equipped with sensors capable of detecting lines on the ground and autonomously following them. This feature enables the robot to navigate predefined paths accurately, making it useful for tasks like warehouse automation or guiding visually impaired individuals.

**Obstacle Avoidance:** 
                  Utilizing sensors such as ultrasonic or infrared, the robot will detect obstacles in its path and navigate around them. This capability ensures safe operation in dynamic environments, preventing collisions and enabling the robot to explore new territories autonomously.

**Android Application Control:**
                  The robot can be controlled remotely using an Android application. Users can send commands to the robot through the application interface, such as initiating specific movements, adjusting speed, or switching between different operational modes. This feature adds flexibility and convenience, allowing users to interact with the robot from a distance.
